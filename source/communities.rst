Ignite Communities
==================

The US Ignite communities are aggregated in ``Hubs``. These hubs can be local communities or cities.

These hubs aggregate information about events and activity happening in the ``Hub``.

``Hubs`` have ``PUBLISHED`` and ``DRAFT`` status that determines its visibility.

The NextGen features listed in a hub are the same features that are available for an application.

The communities can be tagged.

Hub guardians
-------------

The ``Hub`` can have a user that act like a guardian taking care of managing the content of that hub community.

When an Ignite community doesn't have a guardian a link for applying to be a guardian is shown.
