Applications
============

Applications are at the core of US Ignite.


Adding applications
-------------------

Applications can only be submited by registered users. They can be an ``Idea`` or an full ``Application``.

The user can change the status of application between ``DRAFT`` and ``PUBLISHED``.

- ``Draft`` will make the application visible to the owner and members of the application.
- ``Published`` will make the application visible to everyone.

.. note::

    An special ``Removed`` status is provided for the admins to remove any inappropriate content, without deleting it.


Application listing
-------------------

All the public ``Applications`` are listed in the listing view. They are paginated, and they can be ordered as well.


Application detail
------------------

The ``Application`` detail page is visible to everyone when published. When it is on ``Draft`` mode is only available for owners and members.
